    <h1>Interneting is Easy!</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML</p>
    
    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>HEading define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings</p>
    
    <h2>Lists</h2>
    
    <p>This is how you make an unordered list</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Add an "ul" element</li>
        <li>Add each item in it's own "li" element</li>
        <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is what an ordered list looks like</p>

    <ol>
        <li>"ol" is wrapping everything now</li>
        <li>But the item elements are the same</li>
        <li>And will increment on their own.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>

    <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>
    <p>And other times, you need to <strong>shout</strong>!</p>

    <p>This is a test to see if things break <br>
